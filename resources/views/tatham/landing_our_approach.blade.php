            <p>
For more than 30 years, a blue-chip roster of clients
has quietly, almost secretely, turned to Tatham.
Each had its own distinctive problem. Yet each faced a
common situation: how to get the results
targeted by their own strategies, quickly.

          <div class="px-3" style="max-width: 750px;">
            <p>The essence of what we offer is powerful. With the Tatham approach,
            you build an organization capability that can execute strategy and
            get measurable results faster than you thought possible. Plus there’s
            an important side effect: you break the cycle of hell where recurring
            business problems must constantly be solved. We provide a systematic
            process that allows your people to solve problems, once.</p>
            <p>Over the years, we believe there’s no competitive offering that’s
            comparable to ours or has the unbroken, 30-year history of successes
            that we’ve achieved with our clients.</p>
            <p>At Tatham, our approach connects pieces of your strategy puzzle into an
            unanticipated source of competitive advantage: vastly improved business
            processes. Your own people, not us, using tribal knowledge culled from
            the front line of your business, end up delivering results. We simply
            provide your people with the capability, tools and insight to execute your
            business strategy. You begin to see bottom-line results, usually within 90
            days, as your organization’s operating culture transforms itself.</p>
            <p>The Tatham Group has had the distinct privilege of working in the
            background with CEOs at some major companies. Bank of America,
            Rockwell International, IBM Canada, TRW, Hughes Space and Electronic
            Systems, among others. Before retaining us, each sought to improve in
            its own way some aspect of its business operations. Some tried internal
            task forces. Others turned to outside consultants. Many grew frustrated
            with good intentions gone astray. Why? The bottom-line results each
            sought never materialized or could never be sustained</p>

            <p>Working with some of the smartest companies around has taught us
            some important truths about the way we deliver value to them. A few of
            those stark truths are revealed on these pages for you to consider, to
            challenge, and to engage us in a dialogue.</p>
            <p>We encourage you to do so.</p>
