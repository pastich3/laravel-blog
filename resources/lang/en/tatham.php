    This team-building, shared experience with executives and colleagues develops a common vision and language for your Operational Excellence Journey.

    Boot Camp is a business simulator; 17-20 participants experience the five-year journey to becoming a fast, flexible and innovative company in only two days. While on this journey, participants experience the frustrations of trying to meet customer demands, perform tasks, achieve goals and work as a team to apply current management techniques to the most pressing business issue.

    In Boot Camp, your team will discover that intuitive responses lack coordination and cause tremendous difficulties running a profitable business. They will learn a new way of viewing their enterprise so that they are able to see opportunities previously hidden in its complexity. Focus is on the customer, decisions are made using data, and solutions solve at root cause.

    The big ‘aha’ moment for many people is when they see that no matter what the challenge is, they can fix it, because it’s not beyond them. They feel confident they can come up with their own solutions in a systematic and disciplined way.

Boot Camp reveals a fundamental principle about sub-optimal business performance: people are not usually the problem. Ineffective business processes are often what cause micro-management that distracts the organization from its core business practices.

At the completion of the Push Corporation exercise, a debriefing session is used to collect data and document cultural characteristics. This data is used to track the improvements in business performance over the remainder of the two days.

Next, a problem-solving checklist is introduced in order to apply a disciplined approach to solving the company problems. Participants implement a solution and Push Corporation is run a second time to measure and verify results. The journey continues as participants take an end-to-end view of all of Push Corporation’s departments and functions to help identify communication and information transfer problems.

Participants continue to improve the business processes until Push Corporation is flexible, agile, and capable of processing a large volume of different customer orders received one order at a time over the Internet. The simulation is run four times in total during the two days.

At the conclusion of Boot Camp participants identify opportunities for their organization to execute a similar strategy. Tatham facilitators also discuss how to leverage Tatham’s systematic method to achieve breakthrough levels of business performance and financial results as well as developing a list of potential target processes that will be strategic and valuable to redesign.'),

A true advocate of experimentation and discovery, I wholeheartedly follow the scientific method and am inspired by the ambiguity it sometimes creates.

There is no doubt that working along side the founder, my father, demanded a strong work ethic, persistence and ability to constantly challenge the status quo. I have not forgotten this and apply it to Tatham as well as while coaching our clients.

I was introduced to prominent fortune 100 thought leaders from whom I learned a deep understanding of the corporate engine of change. I gained an invaluable skill – the ability to help leaders cut through bureaucracy and find simplicity on the other side of complexity.

My full-time engagement began in 2004. It was then that I discovered my true passion for developing experiential learning products, which allows me to help individuals and companies learn from failure, change the way they think, act in a new way and achieve results. As a young entrepreneur I have gained the respect and reputation as an inspirational coach and have an impressive record of business success on two continents and multiple industries.

The family business isn’t the only thing my father passed along to me. I inherited a love for aviation from a substantial lineage of private aviators. An elite and disciplined hobby that nurtures my desire to continuously learn and refine my skills.'),

I am an avid learner who is dedicated to coaching our customers to help them grow and excel in whatever they set out to achieve. I believe experience is the best teacher and get excited about facilitating our non-computer-based simulators. It’s the interactions with people that makes all the difference.

Besides learning that being a doctor was not what I wanted to be when I grew up, studying at the University of Toronto allowed me to understand that the students are often the best teachers. After completing my pre-med curriculum I added business school to my dossier and dove into refining my skills on how to get people excited and stay engaged.

My greatest leadership challenge, and true passion in life, is being a mother to fabulously unique children. I draw many parallels between parenting and the skills required for good leadership, change management, coaching and development.

Leadership is not a new gig for me. When I was six I was the official manager of the playground at a local amusement park. I would make sure all of the equipment was in safe working condition, the area was clean and no one was left alone on the teeter-totter, young or old. I have always had an ability to strike up a conversation, ask questions and get to the heart of the matter. I enjoy engaging with people and witnessing them achieve more than they thought possible.

Which makes my work a perfect fit. I have the opportunity to work with leaders, managers and workers across many industries and around the world. Travel has allowed my adventurous spirit explore new places, customs and foods like raw herring out of the North sea, durian fruit in Malaysia and kangaroo loin in the southern USA, strange but true. It has also taught me to respect my surroundings while always being true to myself.'),
